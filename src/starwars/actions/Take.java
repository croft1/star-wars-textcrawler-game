/**
 * <code>SWAction</code> that lets a <code>SWActor</code> pick up an object.

 */
/*
 * Changelog
 * 2017/01/26	- candDo method changed. An actor can only take if it's not holding any items already.
 * 				- act method modified. Take affordance removed from the item picked up, since an item picked up
 * 				  cannot be taken. This is just a safe guard.
 * 2017/02/03	- Actors are no longer given a leave action after taking an item.
 * 				- Leave action was removed since students had to add this functionality. (yes there was a leave action
 * 				  but I've failed to document it here)
 * 				- canDo method changed to return true only if the actor is not carrying an item (asel)
