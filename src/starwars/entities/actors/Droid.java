 * Class for Droid SWActors  
 * 
 * Droids are non human SWActors able to follow the player if taken 
 * ownership of. Droid, like all SWActors also have a certain amount of hitpoints that
 * renders them ï¿½mmobile if falling below zero. It is to this need then that
 * the Droid can be dismantled into Droid Parts - and then re-assembled 
 * by using these parts.
 * 
 * Droids also are ownable - thus, if a player comes across a neutral
 * affiliated Droid, they can take up their ownership. Droids do NOT use
 * the Force, so they are essentially the owners' companions!
