#Assumptions on development
 We can assume TuskenRaiders can never have the force 
We will assume Player(Luke) and Ben Kenobi can be subject to attacks from the Force, thus must be able to obey/resist Force. 
Resist Force doesn't have a direct effect on player using Force - it just failed, victim doesn't realise this
