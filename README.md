THE GAME & BACKGROUND TO THE SETTING

The following game, initially deveoped by the FIT2099 staff at Monash University - is a roguelike Star Wars crawler whereby the player takes control as Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars universe. There are various actions, tasks and capabilities that the player can do in the game - each is briefly described below in the "How to Play" section. 

The game has various other 'actors' in the game - notably Obi Wan Kenobi (Ben) - who can train Luke in the Force, various Droids (unnamed Droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO), Tusken Raiders and Aunt Beru & Uncle Owen). Each of these actors has interactions and capacilities they are also able to do to others as well as themselves - which can be found briefly below or in the docs folder of this games' files.

HOW TO PLAY

- By starting the game, the world is generated with the various actors in place - in which you as the player, controls Luke, who is denoted by the at symbol (@).

- The player moves around the map by typing in a integer number corresponding to the choice that they want to make - and hitting Enter on the keyboard. This will use up a 'turn' - where each other actor in the world will also move/attack/heal etc.

- Droids (unnamed generic D1, D2 etc) will wander around the world in search of Oil Canteens to heal themselves with. Luke can take ownership of these Droids by being on the same tile as them. If their HP goes down to 0, Droids become immobile, and must be disasembled (into Droid Parts) and repaired (by using Droid Parts) to bring them back into the game. Droids will follow the player if they Take Ownership (selection), or if they repair a immobile Droid with Droid Parts.

- Tusken Raiders - the scourge of the game - will attack anyone on sight unless they attempt to attack another Tusken Raider. Be wary of these fellows!

- It is important for the player to get a weapon as soon as they can. Across the world are scattered Lightsabers and Blasters for example, that can be picked up and equipped the same way the player moves. Take note that you must wield a weapon to attack foes!

- Ben (Obi Wan) Kenobi can train Luke in the ways of the Force - the mysterious entity of the Star Wars universe. By being trained in the Force, Luke will be able to wield special items like a LightSaber to attack others - and also to Mind Control other actors. Use this to your advantage!

- R2-D2 and C-3PO are two special Droids in the game serving two different purposes. C-3PO for comic relief (he says quotes sometimes) and R2-D2 the Droid Handyman in that if he comes accross any immobile Droids in his path, he will attempt to disassemble or repair them - whatever the case may be. These two special Droids can be owned - but be careful - as they lose their abilities once they become the property of an actor!

- To heal in the game, the player must find a Water Canteen (denoted by "o"). The canteen must be filled at the Moisture Farms before being used - and when the player is holding a Water Canteen that has water in it, a option to heal will become available. The same applies to healing Droids - but the player must find a Oil Can (denoted by a "x").
