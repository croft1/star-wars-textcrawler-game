THE GAME & BACKGROUND TO THE SETTING

The following game, initially deveoped by the FIT2099 staff at Monash University - is a roguelike Star Wars crawler whereby the player takes control as Luke Skywalker from the Star Wars universe. There are various actions, tasks and capabilities that the player can do in the game - each is briefly described below in the "How to Play" section. 

The game has various other 'actors' in the game - notably Obi Wan Kenobi (Ben) - who can train Luke in the Force, various Droids (unnamed Droids, R2-D2 and C-3PO), Tusken Raiders and Aunt Beru & Uncle Owen). Each of these actors has interactions and capacilities they are also able to do to others as well as themselves - which can be found briefly below or in the docs folder of this games' files.

The game has 3 worlds in which the player is able to traverse to. The original location that the user will find themselves on is Tatooine - however by reaching the Millenium Falcon on the map (denoted by a ^) will the Death Star and the rebel base at Yavin IV will be accesible. The player (and their followers) are able to inter travel between these 3 worlds at their will - provided that the game has not been lost!

To officially 'win' the game - the player must take R2-D2 and Princess Leia (who appear on Tatooine and the Death Star successfully) to the rebel base at Yavin IV. In doing so, the held Plans of the Deathstar will be accessible - and will aid the forces of the rebels in their upcoming battle with the Empire!

Another option to 'win' the game is to successfully defeat the strongest enemy of the game. Darth Vader is located on the Death Star naturally - as is an extremely powerul opponent that should not be taken lightly at all. He can attempt to infuence the player into turning into the Dark Side ( turning to Dark side counts as a loss) - and also deliver devastating attacks (including the Force Choke attack).

'Losing' the game occurs if the player or Leia are defeated, if R2-D2 is disassembled or if Luke (the player) turns to the Dark Side. Be wary of what is happening with other non player characters - as it can influence how the game pans out!


HOW TO PLAY

- By starting the game, the world of Tatooine is generated with the various actors in place - in which you as the player, controls Luke, who is denoted by the at symbol (@).

- The player moves around a map by typing in a integer number corresponding to the choice that they want to make - and hitting Enter on the keyboard. This will use up a 'turn' - where each other actor in the world will also move/attack/heal etc.

- Droids (unnamed generic D1, D2 etc) will wander around Tatooine in search of Oil Canteens to heal themselves with. Luke can take ownership of these Droids by being on the same tile as them. If their HP goes down to 0, Droids become immobile, and must be disasembled (into Droid Parts) and repaired (by using Droid Parts) to bring them back into the game. Droids will follow the player if they Take Ownership (selection), or if they repair a immobile Droid with Droid Parts.

- Tusken Raiders - the scourge of the game - will attack anyone on sight unless they attempt to attack another Tusken Raider. Be wary of these fellows! Note that they only appear on the Tatooine map - an added bonus!

- It is important for the player to get a weapon as soon as they can. Across Tatooine are scattered Lightsabers and Blasters for example, that can be picked up and equipped the same way the player moves. Take note that you must wield a weapon to attack foes!

- Ben (Obi Wan) Kenobi can train Luke in the ways of the Force - the mysterious entity of the Star Wars universe. Ben is located around his hut in the world of Tatooine. By being trained in the Force, Luke will be able to wield special items like a LightSaber to attack others - and also to Mind Control other actors. Use this to your advantage!

- R2-D2 and C-3PO are two special Droids in the game serving two different purposes. C-3PO for comic relief (he says quotes sometimes) and R2-D2 the Droid Handyman in that if he comes accross any immobile Droids in his path, he will attempt to disassemble or repair them - whatever the case may be. These two special Droids can be owned - but be careful - as they lose their abilities once they become the property of an actor! Both R2-D@ and C-3PO reside on Tatooine.

- To heal in the game, the player must find a Water Canteen (denoted by "o"). The canteen must be filled at the Moisture Farms before being used - and when the player is holding a Water Canteen that has water in it, a option to heal will become available. The same applies to healing Droids - but the player must find a Oil Can (denoted by a "x").

- Inter world travel is possible by the use of the Millenium Falcon - depicted by a "^". This will allow the player and their followers to traverse inbetween Tatooine, the Death Star and Yavin IV at will.

- Yavin IV contains the main rebel base - against the Emrpire. On Yavin IV, Mon Mothma and General Ackbar and anxiously awaiting the services of their General - Leia Organa (also Lukes twin brother), who is trapped on the Death Star - awaiting rescuing!

- The Death Star is home to many Stormtroopers and Darth Vader - or as he is really, Anakin Skywalker. The Dark Side has taken Princess Leia as hostage - who is residing on the opposite corner to where the player arrives. As soon as the player encounters Leia - she will follow him in need of safe escort back to Vain IV - in avoidance of the Empires' troops. Navigating the Death Star can be troublesome - as the Stormtroopers can be bothersome in numbers - along with the chance of them calling in another Stormtrooper for backup. Not to mention the HUGE threat Darth Vader poses - so be wary when going to the enermies' strnonghold!
